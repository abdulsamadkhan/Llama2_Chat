This can potentially lead to tax evasion when a person deliberately conceals or fails to declare their offshore assets to tax authorities in order to avoid paying taxes on income generated from those assets. By hiding offshore assets, individuals may underreport their income, leading to lower tax liabilities than what they actually owe. This evasion of taxes through offshore assets is illegal and can result in severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment, as outlined in tax laws and regulations.","[""['An offshore asset is an asset located or structured outside of a person’s country of residence or citizenship in order to reduce or avoid taxes. It can take many forms, such as holding foreign bank accounts or investments, utilizing trusts or foreign entities, investing in foreign real estate, or having a business incorporated in a foreign country. Tax evasion is illegal and refers to the intentional attempt to avoid paying taxes by failing to declare income or understating a liability intentionally in order to reduce or avoid tax obligations. Offshore assets can be used to facilitate this type of behavior, which is why the term “offshore enabler” was introduced in the context of the law.

   - Any salary received by an employee in a tax year, except for salary that is exempt from tax, is chargeable to tax under the head ""Salary.""
   - For resident persons, all income earned, including salary income from employment, whether received physically or online, is taxable in Pakistan.
   - This means that if you are a resident Pakistani earning salary income, you are required to pay taxes on that income.

2. **Non-Resident Persons:**
   - The income of a non-resident person under the head of salary is computed by taking into account only amounts that are Pakistan-source income.
   - For non-resident persons, only income earned from a Pakistan source is taxable.
   - If a non-resident Pakistani earns salary income from a foreign employer, that income is exempt from tax in Pakistan. However, tax may be deducted at the source by the country where the income is earned and then submitted to the relevant government.

You are allowed a deduction for the depreciation of your depreciable assets used in your business in the tax year.

If a depreciable asset is used partly for deriving income from business chargeable to tax and partly for other uses, the deduction allowed for that year will be restricted to the fair proportional part of the amount that would be allowed if the asset was wholly used to derive income from business chargeable to tax.

Furthermore, if you dispose of a depreciable asset in a tax year, no depreciation deduction shall be allowed for that year. Depending on whether the consideration received exceeds or is less than the written down value of the asset at the time of disposal, specific tax implications apply.

1. **Foreign-Controlled Resident Company:** 
   - Your company must be a resident company in Pakistan where fifty percent or more of the underlying ownership is held by a non-resident person (foreign controller) either alone or with associates.

2. **Foreign Debt Calculation:** 
   - Calculate the foreign debt, which is the highest amount at any time in a tax year of:
     - The outstanding balance on any debt owed to a foreign controller or non-resident associate on which profit is payable and is not fully taxed in Pakistan.
     - The outstanding balance on any debt owed to a person other than the foreign controller where that person has a similar amount owed to the foreign controller.

3. **Foreign Equity Calculation:** 
   - Calculate the foreign equity, which is the sum of various amounts related to the company's equity.

If the foreign debt-to-equity ratio exceeds three to one at any time during a tax year, the profit on debt paid by the company exceeding this ratio will have a deduction disallowed. This means that the company will not be able to claim a deduction for the profit on debt paid on that excess debt portion.

These rules are in place to regulate thin capitalization and ensure that the company's debt structure is not overly leveraged with foreign debt compared to equity.","[""['The specific rules a company operating in Pakistan must follow to determine whether the foreign debt-to-equity ratio exceeds three to one any time during the tax year is to calculate the sum of the following amounts: (a) The balance outstanding at that time on any debt obligation owed by the foreign-controlled resident company to a foreign controller or non-resident associate of the foreign controller on which profit on debt is payable which profit on debt is deductible to the foreign-controlled resident company and is not taxed under this Ordinance or is taxable at a rate lower than the 1[corporate rate] of tax applicable on assessment to the foreign controller or associate; (b) The balance outstanding at that time on any debt obligation owed by the foreign-controlled resident company to a person other than the foreign controller or an associate of the foreign controller where that person has a balance outstanding of a similar amount on a debt obligation owed by the person to the foreign controller or a non-resident associate of the foreign controller; (c) The paid-up value of all shares in the company owned by the foreign controller or a non-resident associate of the foreign controller at the beginning of the tax year; (d) So much of the amount standing to the credit of the share premium account of the company at the beginning of the 1 The words “corporate tax” substituted by the Finance Act, 2002 196 tax year as the foreign controller or a non-resident associate would be entitled to if the company were wound up at that time; and (e) So much of the accumulated profits and asset revaluation reserves of the company at the beginning of the tax year as the foreign controller or a non-resident associate of the foreign controller would be entitled to if the company were wound up at that time; If the sum of the amounts is in excess of three to one of the foreign debt-to-foreign equity ratio, the deduction for the profit on debt paid by the company in that year on that part of the debt which exceeds the three to one ratio will be disallowed.']""]",1,1,0.955102613,tensor(0.8612),0.8612

Here are some potential outcomes:

1. **Penalties and Fines**: One of the immediate consequences of not filing tax returns or meeting tax obligations is the imposition of penalties and fines by the tax authorities. These penalties can accumulate over time if the issue is not resolved promptly.

2. **Legal Consequences**: Failure to comply with tax laws can lead to legal consequences. This may include legal action taken against the taxpayer, which could result in court appearances, further fines, or even imprisonment in severe cases.

3. **Interest Charges**: If taxes are not paid on time or accurately, the tax authorities may impose interest charges on the outstanding amount. This means that the taxpayer would end up paying more than the original tax due.

4. **Additional Taxes**: In addition to penalties and interest charges, failing to comply with taxation requirements can result in the imposition of additional taxes by the authorities. This can significantly increase the financial burden on the taxpayer.

5. **Investigations**: Tax authorities may launch investigations into the taxpayer's financial affairs if there are suspicions of non-compliance or tax evasion. These investigations can be time-consuming, stressful, and may result in further penalties or legal actions.

6. **Risk of Audit**: Non-compliance with tax requirements increases the likelihood of being selected for a tax audit by the authorities. During an audit, all financial records and transactions will be scrutinized, which can be an intrusive and demanding process.

7","['[""According to section 177 and 122 of the taxation requirements of the Ordinance, failure to comply with these requirements without providing evidence of reasonable cause could lead to a range of consequences. These could include the disabling of the taxpayer’s bank account used for business transactions, the levying of default surcharges, penalties, and any unpaid taxes that have been sought to be evaded, and the issuing of an income tax general order against the person if they are not appearing on the active taxpayers\' list but are liable to file a return. Any revised return would also need to include the amount of taxes sought to be evaded, the default surcharge, and either 25% or 50% of the penalties depending on the circumstances, and could still lead to any of the other consequences if the taxpayer had still not complied with the requirements.""]']",1,0.5,0.954369152,tensor(0.8369),0.8369

Regarding the effect on the cost of assets during transfer under sub-section (3), the asset acquired by the transferee is treated as having the same character as it had in the hands of the transferor. The cost of acquisition for the transferee depends on the type of asset transferred, such as depreciable assets, stock-in-trade, or other assets. Additionally, any deductions under specific sections that have not been set off by the transferor before the transfer are added to the deductions of the transferee in the tax year of the transfer.","['According to the context provided, the expression ""Companies Ordinance, 1984 (XLVII of 1984)"" was substituted by ""Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017)"" on or after the first day of July, 2007. This substitution has an effect on the cost of assets during transfer under sub-section (3) in that the transferee\'s cost in respect of acquiring the asset will be based on the written down value of the asset or intangible immediately before the disposal in the case of a depreciable asset or amortised intangible. In the case of a stock-in-trade, the transferee\'s cost will be based on the value for tax purposes as determined under sub-section (4) of section 35. In any other case, the transferor\'s cost at the time of disposal will be considered. Additionally, if the transferor had any deductions not yet set off against their income, these deductions will be added to the transferee\'s deduction allowed in the tax year in which the transfer is made. This applies to transfers where shares are issued by virtue of a Scheme of Arrangement and Reconstruction under the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) or the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 (LVII of 1962) and are then disposed of.']",1,0.8,0.922420942,tensor(0.8977),0.8977
